      <p>
        Keep track of thousands of articles and blog posts. Find anything you've
        spent more than a minute or two reading.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-6">How it works</h2>
      <p>
        Digraph allows you to categorize links under one or more topics,
        and topics can be as specific as you want. Think of a topic or
        phrase that you might look for when trying to find a link.
        The next time you search for the link, if the original topic wasn't
        helpful, recategorize the link under whatever group of topics and
        phrases came to mind during the search.
      </p>

      <p>
        Specific topics and phrases can be placed under more general topics
        and phrases. Subtopics can belong to more than one parent topic.
      </p>

      <p>
        Digraph is different from browser bookmark managers in that it does
        not assume that the number of links you'll want to keep around will
        be in the tens or hundreds. By making it easy to build out a
        large collection of topics, Digraph allows you to keep track of
        thousands and even tens of thousands of links.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-6">Getting started</h2>
      <p>
        Log in with <a href="/auth/github">Github</a> to get
        started.  You can also take a look at some of the links and topics
        that have been added to the public collection
        <a href="/">here</a>.
        Links and topics can be private or public.
